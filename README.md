👋

I’m Ben (@benjaminwoods).

My bread-and-butter is Python, although I write quite a lot in JS/TS these days.

I do most of my day-to-day work on GitLab. You can see my day-to-day output there: https://gitlab.com/benjaminwoods

(If my GitLab stream is looking particularly heavy, I will probably be switching off in the evening, and so I probably won't be that responsive on here!)

I mostly use GitHub for fun projects + small bits of open-source work, and so I've opted not to port private commits from other git providers (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) to boost my GitHub stats. If you are at all interested in porting private commits from GitLab to GitHub, I would point you in the direction of [this lovely Go project](https://github.com/alexandear/import-gitlab-commits) from [@alexandear](https://github.com/alexandear).

Current stack + technologies:
- ☕: Node.js, React, Next.js, Babel, ES6, Jest, Electron
- 🐍: Python >=3.7, pytest, connexion, Flask
- 🗃️: MongoDB, DynamoDB, SQLite
- 🛠️: Docker, Poetry, Yarn, Verdaccio, GitLab
