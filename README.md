👋

I’m Ben (@benjaminwoods).

My bread-and-butter is Python, although I write quite a lot in JS/TS these days.

I mostly use GitHub for fun projects + small bits of open-source work, and so I've opted not to port private commits from other git providers (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) to boost my GitHub stats. If you are at all interested in porting private commits from GitLab to GitHub, I would point you in the direction of [this lovely Go project](https://github.com/alexandear/import-gitlab-commits) from [@alexandear](https://github.com/alexandear).

Current stack + technologies:
- ☕: Node.js, React, Next.js, Babel, ES6, Jest
- 🐍: Python >=3.8, pytest, connexion, Flask, Django, DRF, FastAPI
- 🗃️: PostgreSQL, Firebase
- 🛠️: Docker, Poetry, Yarn, GitLab
- 🌐: OAS3, OAuth, JWT

Main side project: [derek](https://github.com/benjaminwoods/derek)

I'm currently learning:
- Rust
- Nim
